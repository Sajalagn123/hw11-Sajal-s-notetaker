# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
I am tasked with creating a note taker app that allows the user to enter a list of notes and save them to the application. 

I added routes to the server.js file along with the html and api routes files as well.

I added functional delete buttons, so users can delete the individual notes they select.

## Installation 
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.

## Usage
Users will be able to write down notes and save them along with labeling each entry with a title. The user can delete their entry as well if they desire.

## License
None

## Contributions
I worked on this project alone

## Tests
Enter any notes on the right side of the application.

When finished, click on the save icon. The save icon should look like this:

The notes should then be saved to the left side of the screen.

To see if the delete button is functional, click on the red trash can icon to the right of the saved notes and the entry should be automatically deleted.
