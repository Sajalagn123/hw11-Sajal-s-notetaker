# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
I am tasked with creating a note taker app that allows the user to enter a list of notes and save them to the application. 

I added routes to the server.js file along with the html and api routes files as well.

Fixed the start button so it sends user to application. Also fixed the save button so it stores notes that the user has entered.
